        <title>Jupyter Notebook: Python Data Analysis</title>
        <description>Data analysis programs using Jupyter Notebook, and numpy and pandas libraries in python.
                    Programs read data from an excel sheet (dynamic or static), and perform a number of actions 
                    such as PERT analyses, summary analytics, and/or Agile technique calculations. The actions are based on
                    user input.
                    Core concepts and code are being integrated into Snowflake, which connects directly with our PM Software
                    via an API connection. </description>
