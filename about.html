        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> My name is Matthew Voggel. I am a Product Manager working remotely at UPMC Health Plan, a healthcare insurer
            based in Pittsburgh, PA. You'll see more details below, but in the past 7 years I have slowly 
            moved into web development and technology, and made the decision during the pandemic to go back to school 
            to get my my MS in Computer Science while still working full-time. 
        </p>
        <p> With only one class to graduate, I am now looking to how I will use my degree.  My main goal is to find something meaningful to work toward, and gain industry knowledge that 
            few others have. I am a perennial learner, and am not satisfied with knowing an answer - I enjoy the task of understanding and mastering it. I have been lucky to dip my toe into pretty 
            much every aspect of software development, from data analytics, to DevOps, to Product Ownership. I'm obsessed with learning about it all, and I am looking forward to continually growing 
            and delivering for an organization.
