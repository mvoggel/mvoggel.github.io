        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> My name is Matthew Voggel. I am a Product Manager working remotely at UPMC Health Plan, a healthcare insurer
            based in Pittsburgh, PA. You'll see more details below, but in the past 7 years I have slowly 
            moved into web development and technology, and made the decision during the pandemic to go back to school 
            to get my my MS in Computer Science while still working full-time. 
        </p>
        <p> With only one class to graduate, I am now looking to how I will use my degree. </p>
